;; Pipe-dream: PART 2 Official Solution v1.1
;; NOTE if using this solution for part 3:
;; - Do not delete lines that starts with ;;! when editing this solution.
;; - If this solution needs to be modified, we will make
;;   an announcement on Piazza in the post titled "Homework 11 Clarifications".
;;   So check Piazza often!
;; - Some tests are omitted from this file. You do not have to fill the tests in
;;   if you are just using these functions elsewhere in your code. However, you have to write tests for all
;;   the functions you modify, excluding the ones that returns an image.

;; Complete Task 7 here, after you have finished all other tasks.
